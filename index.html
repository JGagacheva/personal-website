            <p>I am a recent Master of Engineering graduate from UC Berkeley
              where I focused on Data Science and Machine Learning in bioengineering.
              I previously worked on combinatorial
              genetics research combining statistics, analytics, and genetics.

            <h3>Large Language Models for novel chemical compoud development</h3>
            <p> Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on natural languages and, therefore, are not good at generating output that's not a natural language. I am curious feed chemical text data (<a href="/about/about_team.htm">SMILEs</a>) into LLMs to develop novel chemicals. Currently, I am fine-tunning Bloom and GPT. For this task, I sourced and tokenized the data.</p>
