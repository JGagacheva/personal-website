            <p>I am a recent Master of Engineering graduate from UC Berkeley.
              I previously worked on research combining statistics, analytics, and genetics. I am currently interested in data, modeling, and ML.

          <h3>Generative AI for novel chemical compoud development</h3>
          <p> Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on natural languages and, therefore, are not good at generating output that's not a natural language. I am curious about feeding chemical text data (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system">SMILEs</a>) into LLMs to develop novel chemicals. Currently, I am fine-tunning Bloom and GPT.</p>

          <h3>Machine Learning for Molecular Docking</h3>
          <p> One aspect of drug discovery is determining whether a target and a drug bind. I trained and compared two neural nets -- CNN and ResNet -- in PyTorch to predict whether a drug compound of interest will bind a target.

          <h3>Capstone Project @ <br> UC Berkeley</h3>
          <p> In collaboration with an industry partner, I led a team of students to better understand historical trends for fund distribution and capital investements. We tested multiple models and implemented LSTM for time-series forecasting.

          <h3>Biodiversity in the Ecosystem</h3>
          <p> As part of a graduate data science project, I implemented time-series analysis to explore the effects of climate and geographic factors on local biodiversity using scikit-learn. Additionally to the statistical analysis and ML modeling, I led the project and wrote an extensive final report.

          <h3>Master of Engineering @ Berkeley</h3>
          <p> Between August 2021 and May 2022, I pursued a master's program at UC Berkeley, where I focused on ML and data science in bioengineering. Some of the notable coursework includes: Machine Learning, Statistical Models, and Optimization for Molecular Problems, Principles and Techniques of Data Science, and Probabilistic Modeling.
          Additionally, I was awarded the Fung Excellence Scholarship.

          <h3>IDG @ UCSF</h3>
          <p> "The overall goal of the IDG Program is to catalyze research in areas of biology that are currently understudied but that have high potential to impact human health"[excerpt <a href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/idg">from the project website</a>]. I worked as a research associate to carry out various experiments, automate analysis for genetic data, analyze and make sense of large dataset, and contribute to the development of cell and cancer image ML classifier. I presented some of my work at the National Institute of Health - FASEB Science Research Conference and wrote a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-020-00092-2">publication</a>.
